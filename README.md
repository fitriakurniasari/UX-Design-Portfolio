# UX-Design-Portfolio
I am a former Oil & Gas Engineer who fall in love with UX
design. I used my experience in data analysis to help me
grow in UX design and research. Every time I used website
or mobile apps which ease my life I always wonder about the
team behind it and want to be a part of it. A meaningful user
experience can define the customer journey on website or
mobile apps that make a business to success. Let me know
how we can collaborate together to grow.
